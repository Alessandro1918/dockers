    # Error: exec /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: exec format error
    # Description: is an error you get when you try to run a binary for architecture X on a machine with architecture Y, and the machine is not set up to translate CPU instructions from X to Y.
    # Host plataform: My Mac, Intel chip, running AMD (Apple M1 chip runs ARM)
    # Fix:
    platform: linux/arm64
    # container_name: mysql-container
    #V1 - Map vars one by one, if service vars are not named like ".env" file vars:
    # environment:
    #   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    #   # ...
    #   MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE}
    #V2 - Give the service access to the entire ".env" file:
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
    #Here, unlike previous examples, the “app” service is running @ localhost, and the “db” service is (the only service) running in the docker container. So, this time I do have to expose (publish) the ports out of the container.
    #Also, I could have added “DATABASE_PORT” @ the .env file, to avoid leaving the port number hardcoded here.
    ports:
    - "3306:3306"
